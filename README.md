### Instalation

This project uses **Vagrant** with **VirtualBox** to setup a virtual environment to develop and test it.

- **Vagrant**: https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html
- **VirtualBox**: https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads

After installing both, you just have to run vagrant up and the system will install a Debian virtual machine and the it will proceed to install all its dependencies and configure the server for the web page to work.

´´´bash
vagrant up
´´´
